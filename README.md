# Streamlabs Chat Theme For Streamelements
 This is a Streamelements custom chat widget themed in the style of the Streamlabs chat widget for those that want to support a better company but still want that styling

This was created with https://github.com/StreamElements/widgets/tree/master/CustomChat as a template.

Install:
1. Create a custom widget on Streamelements overlays
2. Open Editor
3. Go to the "Custom Widget Files" folder in this github and copy the contents of each of the files into their corresponding sections in the Widget Editor.
4. You can then change settings like Messages limit, hide after time, ignored users, background color, and animations in the Settings section of the widget. (I personally use [Text shadow 0px 0px 7px #000000] and [Animation in slideInLeft])
